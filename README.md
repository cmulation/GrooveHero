# GROOVEHero - audio mixing web app

This fun team project was part of the Music Proramming module in Computer Science and Software Engineering cours.

It's a web-based application built using **REACT** which allows users to mix different beats and audio samples, experiment with various styles, record and save their tracks. 
It also has some additional features, like applying audio effects on music tracks.


**Agile** approach was used throughout the development of this project to help with managing tasks and time efficiently.
This included but was not limited to SCRUM poker, user story map, sequence diagram, use case diagram, and UML diagram.

Below is a short summary of my contribution to the project starting from the GUI sketches I created for all components of the application using Balsamiq Wireframes. I also created all audio for mixing sounds in the application using FL Studio software.

This is the user profile part of the application which I developed using **REACT**. It contains user details, user recordings, frequently used styles and favorite styles.

The user can update their details through a form which sends the new user information to **Firebase** where it is updated and stored. This also applies to the user profile picture. The image is stored in the **Firebase storage** with the corresponding user ID and is retrieved from there to be displayed on the page.
